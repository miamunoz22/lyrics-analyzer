# Lyrics emotion classification

In this project, I benchmarked several models to classify emotions associated with lyrics from a pre-labeled dataset of songs. 

The project uses the Multi-modal MIREX Emotion Dataset from Kaggle. The annotation strategy consisted of 3 raters assessing a given song's associated emotion, and only a subset of agreement by 2 out of 3 was extracted. The categorical classification led to 5 "clusters": Cluster 1 (passionate, rousing, confident, boisterous, rowdy), Cluster 2 (rollicking, cheerful, fun, sweet, amiable/good natured), Cluster 3 (literate, poignant, wistful, bittersweet, autumnal, brooding), Cluster 4 (humorous, silly, campy, quirky, whimsical, witty, wry), Cluster 5 (aggressive, fiery, tense/anxious, intense, volatile, visceral).
